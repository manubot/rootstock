## Abstract {.page_break_before}




## Manubot Rootstock Information

**Note: Manubot instances should delete this file.**

The Manubot is a system for automating scholarly publishing.
Content is written in [Pandoc Markdown](http://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown) source files.
See [`USAGE.md`](https://github.com/greenelab/manubot-rootstock/blob/master/USAGE.md) for more information on how to use the Manubot.

The Manubot project began with the [Deep Review](https://github.com/greenelab/deep-review), where it was used to compose a highly-collaborative review article [@tJKvnIaZ].
Other manuscripts that were created with Manubot include:

+ The Sci-Hub Coverage Study ([GitHub](https://github.com/greenelab/scihub-manuscript), [HTML manuscript](https://greenelab.github.io/scihub-manuscript/))
+ Michael Zietz's Report for the Vagelos Scholars Program ([GitHub](https://github.com/zietzm/Vagelos2017), [HTML manuscript](https://zietzm.github.io/Vagelos2017/)) [@15nwuvjrA]
